# Research Methodology Essentials for Exam

Based on the content, here's a concise summary of essential Research Methodology concepts for your exam, designed for quick understanding:

## 1. What is Research?

- **Core Idea:** A systematic and organized way to find answers to questions or solutions to problems. Think of it like being a detective looking for clues to solve a mystery.
- **Why do it?** To discover new knowledge, understand things better, solve practical problems, or test existing theories.
- **Example:** A company wants to know why sales are dropping. Research helps them investigate customer opinions, competitor actions, or market trends to find the reason.

## 2. The Research Process (Like a Recipe)

1.  **Define the Problem:** What exactly are you trying to find out? Be specific. (e.g., Not "Is social media bad?" but "What is the effect of using Instagram for more than 2 hours daily on the sleep quality of teenagers?")
2.  **Review Literature:** See what others have already found out about your topic. Don't reinvent the wheel. (Like checking existing recipes before creating your own).
3.  **Formulate Hypothesis:** Make an educated guess about the answer to your question. (e.g., "Teenagers using Instagram >2 hours daily have poorer sleep quality"). This is what you'll test.
4.  **Research Design:** Plan how you will conduct the research. Who will you study? How will you collect data? (Like choosing your cooking method and ingredients).
5.  **Data Collection:** Gather the information needed (surveys, interviews, experiments, observations).
6.  **Data Analysis:** Make sense of the data you collected using statistical tools or qualitative methods. Look for patterns and relationships.
7.  **Interpretation & Conclusion:** What do your findings mean? Did they support your hypothesis? What are the limitations?
8.  **Report Writing:** Share your findings clearly and logically.

## 3. Types of Research

**Based on Application:**

- **Pure/Basic Research:** Done to increase knowledge, driven by curiosity. (e.g., Studying how black holes are formed).
- **Applied Research:** Done to solve a specific, practical problem. (e.g., Finding a more efficient way to package products).

**Based on Objectives:**

- **Descriptive:** Describes what is happening or the characteristics of a group. (e.g., A survey describing the eating habits of college students). Answers "What?".
- **Correlational:** Looks for relationships between two or more things. Does not prove cause-and-effect. (e.g., Is there a relationship between hours studied and exam scores?). Answers "What is the relationship?".
- **Explanatory (Causal):** Tries to determine why things happen; looks for cause-and-effect. Often involves experiments. (e.g., Does a new teaching method cause better test scores?). Answers "Why?".
- **Exploratory:** Done when you know very little about a topic, to get initial ideas and insights. (e.g., Interviewing early adopters of a new technology to understand their experience).

**Based on Inquiry Mode:**

- **Quantitative:** Uses numbers, measurements, and statistical analysis. Objective. Think surveys with rating scales, experiments with measurable outcomes. (e.g., Measuring the average height of students).
- **Qualitative:** Uses non-numerical data like interviews, observations, text analysis. Explores experiences, opinions, meanings. Subjective. (e.g., Conducting in-depth interviews to understand why people prefer a certain brand).
- **Mixed Methods:** Combines both quantitative and qualitative approaches.

## 4. Sampling (Choosing Who to Study)

- **Population:** The entire group you are interested in (e.g., All university students in your country).
- **Sample:** A smaller, manageable subgroup selected from the population. You study the sample to make inferences about the population.
- **Why Sample?** It's usually impossible or too expensive/time-consuming to study everyone.
- **Key Goal:** Get a representative sample – one that accurately reflects the characteristics of the population.
- **Types of Sampling:**
  - **Probability Sampling (Random):** Everyone in the population has a known chance of being selected. More likely to be representative.
    - **Simple Random:** Like drawing names from a hat.
    - **Systematic:** Selecting every nth person from a list.
    - **Stratified:** Divide population into groups (strata, e.g., male/female) then randomly sample from each group. Ensures representation of key groups.
    - **Cluster:** Divide population into clusters (e.g., cities), randomly select clusters, then sample everyone within selected clusters.
  - **Non-Probability Sampling (Non-Random):** Selection is not based on chance. Easier and cheaper, but higher risk of bias (sample might not represent population well).
    - **Convenience:** Choosing whoever is easiest to reach (e.g., surveying students in your own class).
    - **Purposive/Judgmental:** Selecting specific people because they have characteristics you need (e.g., interviewing experts).
    - **Quota:** Like stratified, but selection within groups is non-random (e.g., find 20 men and 20 women, whoever is available first).
    - **Snowball:** Ask initial participants to refer others. Useful for hard-to-reach populations.

## 5. Data Collection Methods

- **Surveys/Questionnaires:** Asking people questions (written or online). Good for collecting data from many people quickly.
  - _Watch out for:_ Leading questions, ambiguous wording.
- **Interviews:** Asking questions face-to-face or over the phone. Allows for in-depth understanding and follow-up questions. Can be structured (same questions for all) or unstructured (more conversational).
- **Observations:** Watching and recording behavior or events as they happen. Can be participant (researcher joins in) or non-participant (researcher watches from outside).
- **Experiments:** Manipulating one variable (independent variable) to see its effect on another variable (dependent variable) while controlling other factors. Best for establishing cause-and-effect. (e.g., Giving one group a new drug and another a placebo).
- **Secondary Data Analysis:** Using data already collected by others (e.g., government statistics, company records). Saves time and money but data might not perfectly fit your needs.

## 6. Variables

- **Independent Variable (IV):** The variable you manipulate or change; the presumed cause. (e.g., Amount of fertilizer).
- **Dependent Variable (DV):** The variable you measure; the presumed effect. (e.g., Plant height).
- **Mnemonic:** The **D**ependent variable **D**epends on the **I**ndependent variable.
- **Control Variable:** Variables kept constant to prevent them from influencing the relationship between IV and DV.

## 7. Hypothesis Testing

- **Hypothesis:** A specific, testable prediction about the relationship between variables.
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** States there is _no_ effect or _no_ difference. It's the default assumption you try to disprove. (e.g., H₀: There is no difference in sleep quality between teenagers using Instagram >2hrs/day and those who don't).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha):** States there _is_ an effect or difference (what the researcher actually expects). (e.g., H₁: Teenagers using Instagram >2hrs/day have poorer sleep quality).
- **Goal:** Collect evidence to see if you can _reject_ the Null Hypothesis in favor of the Alternative Hypothesis.
- **Significance Level (alpha, α):** Usually set at 0.05 (or 5%). It's the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true (making a Type I error).
- **P-value:** The probability of observing your data (or more extreme data) _if the null hypothesis were true_.
  - If **p ≤ α** (e.g., p ≤ 0.05): **Reject H₀**. Results are statistically significant. Evidence supports H₁.
  - If **p > α** (e.g., p > 0.05): **Fail to reject H₀**. Results are not statistically significant. Not enough evidence to support H₁.

## 8. Validity and Reliability (Important for Quality)

- **Reliability:** Consistency. If you repeat the measurement, will you get the same results? (Think: a _reliable_ scale shows the same weight each time).
- **Validity:** Accuracy. Are you actually measuring what you intend to measure? (Think: a scale is _valid_ if it correctly measures weight, not height).
- **Internal Validity:** Confidence that the IV caused the change in the DV (important in experiments).
- **External Validity:** Can the results be generalized to other people, settings, or times?

## 9. Research Report Structure

Standard sections usually include:

1.  Title
2.  Abstract (brief summary)
3.  Introduction (background, problem, objectives, hypothesis)
4.  Literature Review
5.  Methodology (how you did it - design, sample, data collection, analysis)
6.  Results/Findings (present the data, often with tables/charts)
7.  Discussion (interpret results, link to literature, limitations)
8.  Conclusion (summary of main findings, implications)
9.  References
10. Appendices (e.g., questionnaire)

**Key Takeaway/Mnemonic:** Think "**RD-SD-AC-R**" for the core process: **R**esearch question/problem -> **D**esign -> **S**ampling -> **D**ata Collection -> **A**nalysis -> **C**onclusions -> **R**eport.

Focus on understanding the _purpose_ of each concept (why do we need sampling? why test hypotheses?) and the basic _differences_ between key terms (e.g., quantitative vs. qualitative, reliability vs. validity, IV vs. DV). Good luck with your exam!
